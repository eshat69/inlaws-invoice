# inlaws-invoice

A tongue‑in‑cheek “wedding economics” toy app that satirizes dowry culture by turning it into a
transparent, tweakable calculator. Use it to spark conversations, not to normalize dowry.
Ethics disclaimer: Dowry is harmful and illegal in many places. This project is satire + tech
demo. The default configuration strongly nudges toward Zero Dowry (see Positive Mode).
Don’t use this to justify payments.
